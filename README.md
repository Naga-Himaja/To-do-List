# To do list using React

Hello everyone! 

I am new to React and this is my first ever project in React! I used [this medium article](https://medium.com/@worachote/building-a-todo-list-app-with-reactjs-a-step-by-step-guide-2c58b9b6c0f5) as reference to build this.

## Running this application

You can start with downloading this project zip file or cloning this repo.

Note: Ensure you have the dependencies installed.

After installed the dependencies, you can start the application using 

`npm start`

You should be able to find the output at your local host: `http://localhost:3000`

Thanks!
